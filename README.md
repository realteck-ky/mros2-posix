# mros2-posix

mROS 2 (formly `mros2`) realizes a agent-less and lightweight runtime environment compatible with ROS 2 for embedded devices. mROS 2 mainly offers pub/sub APIs compatible with [rclcpp](https://docs.ros2.org/dashing/api/rclcpp/index.html) for embedded devices. mROS 2 consists of communication library for pub/sub APIs, RTPS protocol, UDP/IP stack, and real-time kernel. 

This repository provides the implementation of `mros2` as the **pthread**. In other words, `mros2` nodes can be operated onto native Linux kernel and general-purpose computers (e.g., Ubuntu onto x64_PC or arm64_RPi4). We also provide the POSIX layer (`cmsis-posix` and `lwip-posix`) that are prepared for mROS 2 and embeddedRTPS .
Please also check [mros2 repository](https://github.com/mROS-base/mros2) for more details and another implementations onto embedded devices.

## Supported environment

* ROS 2 environment as the communication partner (IOW, host environment):
  * [ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/index.html) on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
  * [ROS 2 Foxy Fitzroy](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/index.html) on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
* `mros2-posix` environment for building & executing app:
  * Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
  * Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
  * The followings can be also used but not fully tested
	  * WSL1 on Windows 10
	  * docker compose

## Envorinmental setup

### ROS 2 Host environment

Please refer to the public documentation

* [Humble Hawksbill](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation.html) on Ubuntu 22.04 LTs
* [Foxy Fitzroy](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Installation.html) on Ubuntu 20.04 LTs

### `mros2-posix` environment for building & executing app:

Install following tools for building mros2-posix application.

```sh
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y \
  git wget \
  build-essential gcc g++ \
  libssl-dev libreadline-dev zlib1g-dev \
  make autoconf automake cmake \
  pkg-config curl \
  net-tools netcat
```

Please check the IP address and netmask of the execution environment. 

Example (ethernet port `enp4s0` in this case):

```console
$ ifconfig
<sniped.>
enp4s0: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
        inet 192.168.11.3  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 192.168.11.255
        ether cc:30:80:3a:7a:de  txqueuelen 1000  (Ethernet)
        RX packets 1292708  bytes 964243524 (964.2 MB)
        RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0
        TX packets 920815  bytes 124650942 (124.6 MB)
        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0
<sniped.>
```

Here, IP address and netmask are `192.168.11.3` and `255.255.255.0`, respectively in this example.

You need to edit the below files to set IP address and netmask.

* IP address and netmask to `include/netif.h`
* IP address to `include/rtps/config.h`

## Getting Started

This section explains how to build and execute mros2-posix application as a Linux/POSIX process, using `echoback_string` as an example (please see workspace/README.md for another examples).

### Build for mros2-posix app

First of all, clone this repository. Note that **--recursive** is mandatory.

```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/mROS-base/mros2-posix.git
```

Please set your network information to the below file.

- IP address to `IP_ADDRESS` in `include/rtps/config.h`
- IP address and netmask to `NETIF_IPADDR` and `NETIF_NETMASK` in `include/netif.h`.

Move to `mros2-posix/` and build with the target app name.

```sh
cd mros2-posix/
bash build.bash clean
bash build.bash all echoback_string
```

Once build process is successfully completed, you can find `mros2-posix` executable in `cmake_build/`. 

### Run the example

Run the mros2-posix application.

```sh
./cmake_build/mros2-posix
```

Example log:

```console
$ ./cmake_build/mros2-posix
...(SNIPPED)...

publishing msg: 'Hello from mros2-posix onto Linux: 8'
...(SNIPPED)...
```

### Run native ROS 2 node on the host environment

One of the easiest way to operate the host is using Docker. On the host terminal, type the command below.

```sh
docker run --rm -it --net=host ros:humble /bin/bash \
  -c "source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash &&
  cd &&
  git clone https://github.com/mROS-base/mros2-host-examples &&
  cd mros2-host-examples &&
  colcon build --packages-select mros2_echoreply_string &&
  source install/setup.bash &&
  ros2 run mros2_echoreply_string echoreply_node"
```

Then, we can confirm the communication between the PC and mros2-posix process via ROS 2.

You can also confirm the topic by `ros2 topic echo /to_stm` or `ros2 topic echo /to_linux`.

## Examples

This repository contains some example applications in [workspace/](workspace/) to communicate with ROS 2 nodes on the host.
You can switch the example by specifying the second argument of `build.bash`.
Of course you can also create a new program file and specify it as your own application.

Please also check [mROS-base/mros2-host-examples](https://github.com/mROS-base/mros2-host-examples) repository for more detail about the host examples.

### echoback_string

- Description:
  - The mROS 2 node publishes `string` (`std_msgs::msg::String`) message to `/to_linux` topic.
  - (The node on the host will echoreply this message as it is.)
  - The mROS 2 node subscribes the replied message from `/to_stm` topic.
- Host operation:
  - `$ ros2 run mros2_echoreply_string echoreply_node`

### echoreply_string

- Description:
  - The mROS 2 node on the subscribes `string` (`std_msgs::msg::String`) message from `/to_stm` topic.
  - And then publishes this `string` message as it is to `/to_linux` as the reply.
- Host operation:
  - at first terminal: `$ ros2 run mros2_echoback_string sub_node`
  - and then, at second terminal: `$ ros2 run mros2_echoback_string pub_node`
  - or, at one terminal:
    - `$ ros2 launch mros2_echoback_string pubsub.launch.py`

### pub_twist

- Description:
  - The mROS 2 node publishes `Twist` (`geometry_msgs::msg::Twist`) message to `cmd_vel` topic.
  - This application requires to generated header files for `Twist` and `Vector3`. See detail in [<repo_root>/README.md#generating-header-files-for-custom-msgtypes](../README.md#generating-header-files-for-custom-msgtypes).
- Host operation:
  - `$ ros2 run mros2_sub_twist sub_node`
  - or, `$ ros2 launch mros2_sub_twist sub.launch.py`

### sub_pose

- Description:
  - The mROS 2 node subscibes `Pose` (`geometry_msgs::msg::Pose`) message to `cmd_vel` topic.
  - This application requires to generated header files for `Pose`, `Point` and `Quartenion`. See detail in [<repo_root>/README.md#generating-header-files-for-custom-msgtypes](../README.md#generating-header-files-for-custom-msgtypes).
- Host operation:
  - `$ ros2 run mros2_pub_pose pub_node`
  - or, `$ ros2 launch mros2_pub_pose pub.launch.py`

## Files for the application

On this platform, the mros2 application consists of the following files:

- app.cpp: 
  - main source of the application
  - note that the file name must be this in order to generate the templates of pub/sub functions in the build step.
- templates.hpp:
  - the templates of pub/sub functions
  - this file will be automatically generated/modified during the build step, so you do not have to care about this file

## Generating header files for custom MsgTypes

You can use almost any [built-in-types in ROS 2](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/Concepts/About-ROS-Interfaces.html#field-types) on the embedded device.

In additon, you can define a customized message type (e.g., `Twist.msg`) in the same way as in ROS 2, and use its header file for your application. This section describes how to generate header files for your own MsgTypes (`geometry_msgs::msg::Twist` as an example).

### Prepare .msg files

`.msg` files are simple text files that describe the fields of a ROS message (see [About ROS 2 interface](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/Concepts/About-ROS-Interfaces.html)). In mros2, they are used to generate header files for messages in embedded applications.

Prepare `Twist.msg` file and make sure it is in `workspace/custom_msgs/geometry_msgs/msg/`.

```console
$ cat workspace/custom_msgs/geometry_msgs/msg/Twist.msg
geometry_msgs/msg/Vector3 linear
geometry_msgs/msg/Vector3 angular
```

In this example, `Twist` has a nested structure with `Vector3` as a child element. So you also need to prepare its file.

```console
$ cat workspace/custom_msgs/geometry_msgs/msg/Vector3.msg
float64 x
float64 y
float64 z
```

### Generate header files

To generate header files for `Twist` and `Vector3`, run the following command in `workspace/`.

```console
$ cd workspace
$ python3 ../mros2/mros2_header_generator/header_generator.py geometry_msgs/msg/Twist.msg
```

Make sure header files for custom MsgType are generated in `custom_msgs/`

```console
$ ls -R custom_msgs/
custom_msgs/:
geometry_msgs

custom_msgs/geometry_msgs:
msg

custom_msgs/geometry_msgs/msg:
twist.hpp  vector3.hpp  Twist.msg  Vector3.msg
```

You can now use them in your applicaton like this.

```cpp
#include "mros2.hpp"
#include "geometry_msgs/msg/vector3.hpp"
#include "geometry_msgs/msg/twist.hpp"

int main(int argc, char * argv[])
{
<snip.>
  pub = node.create_publisher<geometry_msgs::msg::Twist>("cmd_vel", 10);
<snip.>
```
